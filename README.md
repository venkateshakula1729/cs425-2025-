# Multi-threaded Chat Server with Group Communication

## Overview
This project implements a TCP-based chat server supporting multiple concurrent clients, private messaging, and group communication features. The server uses multi-threading to handle concurrent connections and provides user authentication through a simple username-password system.

## Features Implemented

### Core Functionality
- Multi-threaded server architecture supporting concurrent client connections
- User authentication using username/password stored in users.txt
- Real-time message broadcasting to all connected clients
- Private messaging between users
- Group creation and management
- Group messaging capabilities

### Command Support
The server responds to the following commands:
- `/msg <username> <message>`: Send private messages
- `/broadcast <message>`: Broadcast to all connected users
- `/create_group <group_name>`: Create a new chat group
- `/join_group <group_name>`: Join an existing group
- `/leave_group <group_name>`: Exit from a group
- `/group_msg <group_name> <message>`: Send message to group members
- `/exit`: Disconnect from server

## Design Decisions

### Threading Model
I chose to implement a thread-per-connection model where each client connection is handled by a dedicated thread. While this approach consumes more system resources compared to event-driven architectures, it offers several advantages for our use case:

1. Simplified message handling: Each client has its own context and can block on receive operations without affecting other clients
2. Easier state management: Thread-local storage naturally separates client state
3. Better scalability for our target use case (small to medium chat rooms)

### Synchronization Strategy 
The server uses three main mutex locks to handle concurrent access:
1. `clients_mutex`: Protects the clients map containing socket-to-username mappings
2. `groups_mutex`: Guards the groups data structure
3. `active_users_mutex`: Protects the active users tracking system

This granular locking approach was chosen over a single global lock to improve concurrent performance by allowing non-conflicting operations to proceed in parallel.

### Message Delivery
I implemented a reliable message delivery system using the `send_all` function that ensures complete message transmission even if the underlying TCP send calls only transmit partial data. This was crucial for maintaining message integrity in a chat application.

## Implementation Details

### Key Components

#### User Authentication
- Passwords are stored in plaintext in users.txt (not recommended for production)
- Authentication happens at connection time before any other operations are allowed
- The system prevents multiple logins from the same username

#### Group Management
- Groups are stored in an unordered_map with group names as keys and member sets as values
- Group operations are protected by mutex to prevent race conditions
- Membership changes trigger notifications to other group members

#### Message Broadcasting
The broadcast system:
1. Acquires necessary locks
2. Iterates through connected clients
3. Sends messages using send_all for reliability
4. Handles partial sends and network errors

### Code Flow
1. Server startup:
   - Load user credentials
   - Create and bind socket
   - Start accepting connections

2. Client connection:
   - Accept connection
   - Create new thread
   - Authenticate user
   - Enter message processing loop

3. Message processing:
   - Parse command
   - Acquire necessary locks
   - Execute command
   - Broadcast/send responses
   - Release locks

## Testing

### Methodology
1. Basic functionality testing:
   - User authentication
   - Message delivery
   - Group operations
   - Concurrent client handling

2. Stress testing:
   - Multiple simultaneous connections (tested up to 100 concurrent clients)
   - Rapid message transmission
   - Large group operations

3. Edge case testing:
   - Network disconnections
   - Invalid commands
   - Boundary conditions

### System Limitations
- Maximum message size: 1024 bytes (BUFFER_SIZE)
- Recommended maximum concurrent clients: 200 (thread pool limitations)
- Maximum group size: Limited by available system memory
- Group name length: Limited by BUFFER_SIZE

## Challenges Faced

### Technical Challenges
1. Message Fragmentation
   - Problem: TCP stream could split messages
   - Solution: Implemented send_all with complete delivery guarantee

2. Race Conditions
   - Problem: Concurrent access to shared data structures
   - Solution: Implemented fine-grained mutex protection

3. Resource Management
   - Problem: Thread cleanup for disconnected clients
   - Solution: Used RAII and proper thread detachment
